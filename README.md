# ycode front-end test
Hi! Are you ready to join our team working on an innovative and exciting project? We are looking for a Front-end Developer (Vue 3).

For the test assignment, we would like you to create a simple no-code tool that can manipulate layers on a responsive "canvas".

There are 4 main functions we want to be able to perform:

- The canvas must be able to have multiple layers at one time.
- The text inside each layer should be uniquely editable.
- Each layer can be deleted uniquely from the canvas.
- Design for each layer can be affected via tailwindcss.
 
We have provided a base HTML layout for your application. The final result should be achieved without the use of any plugins / libraryâ€™s.
 
It is key for this application to be user-friendly.
 
Use small commits and descriptive commit messages while working on the assignment. One commit solving one issue.

We are expecting you to show both front-end skills and knowledge of Vue 3.
